# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

Created a basic Tic Tac Toe game that can be played within a browser.

Made with a basic HTMl and CSS format. Coding the behavior with vanilla Javascript.

I created this game to practice and understand how to manipulate the DOM and create behavior on a website to make something responsive. I was able to understand event handlers and use them to get the user clicks which creates a mark on the board. I was able to create a restart button, when clicked, would erase the board and restart the program.
